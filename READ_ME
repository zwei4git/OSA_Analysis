A research is investigating obstructive sleep apnea. 
Two questionnaires (STOP, STOPBANG) have been given to patients. 
Body type has been incorporated into the questionnaire scores to create new measures STOPA and STOPBANGA.  
Data are in a file called OSA and also include sex (1 = male 0 = female) and
race (1 = white, 2 = AA, 3 = Hispanic, 4 = Asian, 5 = other))

I first used R to do plot ROCs and perform some staistical test, and find the cutoff point,
then, in python I fitted the data using a decision tree and a random forest to see the sensitivity and specificity.
